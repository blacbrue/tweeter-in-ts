# tweeter-in-ts
The way better version of "Tweeter" and it is written in Typescript

**MAKE AN ISSUE IF THERE IS ANY PROBLEM WITH THE CODE**

Compile `index.ts`

The `tsconfig.json` is already there so you just need to create a `dist` folder then run `tsc`

Then run `node .` to run. Make sure the compiled `index.js` is in a folder with the name: `dist`

Also install dependencies: `npm i` and `npm i -g typescript` (to compile `index.ts`)

Also create a `.env` file copy paste this:

```
API_KEY = "<YOUR API KEY HERE>"
API_KEY_SECRET = "<YOUR API KEY SECRET HERE>"
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = "<YOUR ACCESS TOKEN SECRET HERE>"
ACCESS_TOKEN = "<YOUR ACCESS TOKEN HERE>"
```

Replace `<YOUR API KEY HERE>` and etc with your actual API keys.
